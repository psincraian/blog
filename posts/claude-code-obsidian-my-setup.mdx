I've used Obsidian for 3 years. Capturing notes was never the problem. Organizing them? That's where everything broke down 🥲

My Inbox was a disaster. Notes never got connected. I'd write something and never find it again.

Then, connecting Claude Code to my vault was a game changer.

## The Three Pieces

1. **CLAUDE.md** - Context about my vault structure
2. **MCP Obsidian Server** - Claude can search and read my entire vault across projects
3. **Custom Slash Commands** - Small automations that make my day easy

## CLAUDE.md

The `CLAUDE.md` is simple. Just my folder structure:

```
├── Projects/   # Work + side projects
├── Areas/      # Home, family, habits
├── Resources/  # Learning notes
├── Journal/    # Daily, weekly, monthly
├── Inbox/      # Quick capture
└── Archive/    # Old stuff
```

With this context, Claude routes automatically:

- Python notes → `Resources/Learning/`
- Work bugs → `Projects/Polar/Tasks/`
- Groceries → `Inbox/` as temporary

## The Commands

Commands live in `.claude/commands/*.md`. Each one is just markdown with instructions.

### /morning

My daily check-in. One command shows:

- Top 3 priorities from journal
- Inbox items due today
- Active challenges ("Day 5 of No Phone at Meals")
- Todoist tasks

```markdown
---
description: Morning check-in
allowed-tools: Read, Glob, Grep, mcp__todoist__find-tasks-by-date
---

1. Find today's journal
2. Show priorities
3. Check Inbox for due items
4. Check active challenges in Areas/Rituals/
5. Pull Todoist tasks
```

### /day

This one changed everything. I dump random thoughts:

```
/day fix checkout bug at Polar. Create a new note on why it happened. Also, buy tomatoes
```

Claude parses and creates:

- `Projects/Polar/Tasks/Checkout`
- `Inbox/2025-01-13`

All with proper frontmatter. All with `[[wikilinks]]` to related notes.

```markdown
---
description: Brain dump → auto-creates notes
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Glob, Grep
---

Route each item:
| Type | Folder |
|------|--------|
| Work tasks | Projects/Polar/Tasks/ |
| Errands | Inbox/ with date |
| Learning | Resources/Learning/ |
| Unclear | Ask with 3 suggestions |
```

## Why It Works

I capture fast and Claude organizes.

No more decision fatigue about where notes should go. No more orphaned ideas lost in my Inbox. I just dump and move on with my day.
