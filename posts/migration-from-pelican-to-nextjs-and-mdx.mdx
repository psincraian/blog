---

I've been using Next.js on pepy.tech since 2023, and I fell in love with the framework from the start. Here are some key benefits of using Next.js:

* **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Next.js allows for server-side rendering, which helps with SEO and improves initial page load performance since content is pre-rendered.
* **Static Generation**: You can generate static HTML pages that can be served directly from a CDN, providing even faster load times and better performance.
* **Automatic Code Splitting**: Next.js splits your code into smaller chunks, ensuring that users only load what they need, which speeds up page transitions.
* **Built-in CSS and Sass Support**: Easy integration with CSS, Sass, or CSS-in-JS solutions like styled-components, making styling straightforward.
* **API Routes**: You can create backend routes directly within your Next.js project, simplifying the architecture for full-stack applications.

Next.js is a full React framework that's opinionated, and it offers best practices for frontend development. This has been really useful for me as a backend developer.

## Obsidian and Markdown

I use Obsidian to write my notes in markdown. Having my posts already formatted in markdown significantly reduces the burden of publishing:

* **Seamless Integration**: Since my notes are already in markdown, I can directly convert them into blog posts without needing to rewrite content or deal with complex formatting issues.
* **Reduced Overhead**: This workflow means less time spent on transforming notes into publishable content, allowing for more frequent updates to my blog.
* **Consistency**: Using markdown everywhere keeps my writing consistent, both in notes and published posts, which helps maintain a uniform style across my content.

## What is MDX?

MDX allows you to write JSX in markdown. Here's a simple example:

```mdx
<div style={{backgroundColor: 'violet', padding: '1rem'}}>
    JSX in markdown!
</div>
```

When rendered, this MDX would look like:

<div style={{backgroundColor: 'violet', padding: '1rem'}}>
    JSX in markdown!
</div>


## Rehype and Remark

**Remark** is a Markdown processor that transforms markdown to an abstract syntax tree (AST) and back, used for parsing and manipulating markdown content with plugins.
**Rehype** functions similarly but for HTML, allowing for the processing and transformation of the DOM tree with plugins for various enhancements.

Some of the plugins that I use are the following:

```ts
const withMDX = createMDX({
  extension: /\.mdx?$/,
  options: {
    remarkPlugins: [
      remarkGfm, // Add support for Github Markdown
      remarkFrontmatter, // Add YAML support for markdown. Useful for adding extra information like title or the main image.
      remarkMdxFrontmatter, // same as frontmatter but for MDX.
      readingTime, // give an estimate on how long the text will take to read
      readingMdxTime, // same for MDX
    ],
    rehypePlugins: [
      [
        rehypePrettyCode, { // To add code highlighting
          theme: "github-light",
        }]],
  },
});
```

## Challenges Faced During Migration

The migration wasn't without its hurdles:

* **Tailwind CSS Configuration**: I had to modify Tailwind to include a mdx-components.tsx file for my custom components to work properly within MDX.
* **MDX-Remote Issues**: Initially, I tried using MDX-Remote, but I ran into issues with remark and rehype plugins. However, by looking at [carloscuesta.me source code](https://github.com/carloscuesta/carloscuesta.me/blob/master/src/utils/api/blog/index.ts), I learned that I could directly import and generate MDX, which solved my problems.
* **Migration**: even if the input is plan Markdown, still the migration was time-consuming as the structure of the urls, the files, or the build needed manual adjustments.

This migration has dramatically improved my ability to create dynamic, component-rich content directly from markdown, making my blog more interactive and visually appealing.
