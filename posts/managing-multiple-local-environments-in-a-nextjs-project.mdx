## Introduction

When developing the frontend for pepy.tech, we faced a challenge: needing multiple local development environments. 
Specifically, we wanted the flexibility to toggle between pointing to the live pepy.tech domain and a local backend server. 
While Next.js offers built-in environment variable handling, its default configuration fell short and limited for our use case. 
Hereâ€™s how we solved it (and the trade-offs we encountered).

## The Problem: Next.js Environment File Limitations

Next.js natively supports environment files with the following priority order:

1. `process.env` (directly injected variables)
2. `.env.$(NODE_ENV).local` (e.g., .env.development.local)
3. `.env.local` (ignored in test environments)
4. `.env.$(NODE_ENV)` (e.g., .env.production)
5. `.env`


This structure works well for basic setups, but we needed two distinct local environments:

* **Local Backend**: Connect our local frontend to a backend running on localhost.
* **Live**: Connect our local frontend to the production pepy.tech API.


The default Next.js setup doesnâ€™t allow custom environment "profiles" beyond development, test, and production. Creating a `.env.local_server` file, for example, isnâ€™t natively recognized.


## The Solution: Leveraging env-cmd

To bypass this limitation, we used the env-cmd package. This tool lets you specify a custom `.env` file when running commands.
Hereâ€™s how we implemented it:


**Step 1: Create a Custom Environment File**
Add a `.env.local_server` file with variables specific to your local server (e.g., API endpoints):

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

**Step 2: Update package.json Scripts**

Modify your scripts to include a dedicated command for the local server environment:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev", // Uses default .env.development
    "dev:local": "env-cmd -f .env.local_server next dev"
  }
}
```

**How It Works**

* Running `npm run dev:local` loads variables from `.env.local_server` **first**, followed by Next.jsâ€™s default hierarchy.
* The `env-cmd` tool injects your custom variables into `process.env`, ensuring they take precedence over other .env files.


## Key benefits

1. **No Code Changes Required**: Switch environments by running dev or dev:local.
2. **Clean Separation**: Keep live and local configurations isolated.
3. **Flexibility**: Easily add more environments (e.g., dev:staging) with new .env files.


## The Catch: Hot Reload Limitations

While this approach works, we noticed one downside: changes to `.env.local_server` donâ€™t trigger hot reloads. To apply new values, youâ€™ll need to:

* Stop the dev server (`Ctrl + C`).
* Restart it with `npm run dev:local`.

This occurs because `env-cmd` loads the file once at startup, unlike Next.jsâ€™s built-in environment handling, which watches .env files.


## Conclusion

For projects requiring multiple local environments, `env-cmd` offers a simple yet powerful workaround.
While the hot reload limitation adds a minor inconvenience, the benefits of clean environment separation far outweigh the drawback.

Alternatives to Explore:

* Use a library like `dotenv` with a custom `NODE_ENV` value.
* Dynamically load environment variables at runtime (though this may impact performance).

**Final Tip**: Always add .env*.local to your .gitignore to avoid exposing secrets!
