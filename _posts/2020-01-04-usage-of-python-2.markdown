The main question that we want to answer in this article is that if Python 2 is still used. Then we will try to analyze the evolution of Python 2 and Python 3.

I based all the data on the downloads of packages. When you do a `pip install pytest`, this request is logged into BigQuery with the version of pip, the operating system, and the python version.

The query executed in BigQuery was the following:

```sql
SELECT
 DATE(timestamp) as date,
 details.implementation.version AS python_version,
 COUNT(*) AS downloads
FROM
 `the-psf.pypi.downloads2019*`
GROUP BY
 date, python_version
```

Then for each day, we will have the python version and the number of downloads of that version.

# Python 2 usage
At the beginning of 2019, the usage of Python 2 was having a peak of 60% of all downloads, while Python 3 was having the rest 40%.

By the end of 2019, Python 2 represented 44% of PyPi downloads. So in a year, the usage of Python 2 decreased by 15%. In the next chart, you can see the evolution week by week.

Some interesting thing to notice here is that in the week number 30 of the year, that corresponds to the middle of July, for the first time Python 3 had more downloads than Python 2.

# Evolution of downloads

Now, we only now the percentages of people using Python 2 and Python 3, but we don't know if the number of downloads is increasing or decreasing.

Take a look at the following chart:

![Downloads of Python 2 and Python 3](/assets/2020_downloads_of_python2_and_python3.svg)

Analyzing the number of downloads, we can observe that the downloads of Python 2 are still increasing. At the beginning of 2019, 280 million packages were installed using Python 2 in a week. At the end of the same year, the number of downloads increased to 370 million downloads. Python 2 is growing like 2 million downloads per week.

Python 3 also increased the number of downloads, but at a faster pace. At the beginning of 2019, 218 million packages were installed using Python 3, and at the end, more than 500 million packages. The number of Python 3 downloads grows like 6 million per week, three times more than the growth of Python 2.

# Comments
Take into account that this data is not entirely accurate. There are a lot of factors that can vary these numbers, some of them are:

* Mirrors, there are a lot of companies having their private python repositories.
* Cache, pip and other package managers have a cache in place.
* Bots, there are bots downloading packages and increasing the number of downloads.


I hope this article was interesting :-)
