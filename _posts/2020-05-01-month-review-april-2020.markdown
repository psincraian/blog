This month has been very productive for pepy.tech, we deployed one of the most critical features, we hit new records, and we opened our Patreon account 🤗

# ✨ New features

View download stats by package version is the most significant feature introduced since I started pepy.tech two years ago. With this feature, you can check what is the most popular version of a package, how are the downloads stats evolving per package version or what versions can you deprecate.

Alongside with this feature we deployed:
* View download stats in the versions search box.
* Improve the speed of the versions search box. 
* Improve the footer.
* Update internal libraries.
* Migrate from PostgresSQL to MongoDB.
* Make the copy badge work with older browsers.
* And more!

# 📊 Stats

This month we hit some records:

👥 Over 9900 unique visitors (according to Google Analytics)

💾More than 100 GB analyzed

🌐Over 5 million requests

🔮 Next features

For this month I plan to add the glob pattern, so you will be able to search for versions like 2.* or 3.*

Also, I plan to do some refactoring in the code and tests. Aside from that, I will like to improve the usability of the web, like the ability to share URLs with selected versions.
