This month we have focused on improving one basic thing: user experience. I’m not an expert in UX but there were fundamental issues and some improvements. Hopefully, now the website is easier to use.

# ✨ New features
Some of the new features are:

* Glob pattern, you no longer need to add version by version in the graph.
* Sharable URL, every time you do a modification the URL will change and can be shared.
* Cron moved to 1 am UTC time, now you will get data earlier.
* Show day of the week in the tooltip and mark weekends in the downloads table.
* Improved 404 page, now shows more info ;)
* Some more small changes :-)

# 📊 Stats
This month we hit some records:

👨‍💻️ 25 commits

💻 More than 240k visitors (unique IPs)

🌐 8.35 GB of data sent

💵 $11.45 spent = $6.05 on servers + $5.40 on BigQuery

# 🔮 Next features
This month I will work on the newsletter update. The idea is to have a weekly or monthly email that will show some stats of your project. And, some of these new stats will be new.
