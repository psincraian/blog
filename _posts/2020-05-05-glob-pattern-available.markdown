With the glob pattern, you can search for all versions matching a pattern. For example, you can write 2.* in the versions search box, and the website will show all the versions starting with "2."  Some examples of what you can search:

* 2.*: will match all versions starting with 2.
* 3.*: will match all versions starting with 3.
* 4.1.*: will match all versions starting with 4.1
* *: will match all versions
