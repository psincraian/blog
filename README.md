# Personal blog

Hey, this is my personal blog. I'm a software engineer and I like writting about different things related to programming. I usually write about CS topics, Python, Java, and personal projects.

This blog is built with [pelican](https://getpelican.com/), a static site generator.

## Useful commands

Start the server with auto reload:

```shell
pelican -l -r
```

Generate the site:

```shell
pelican content
```
