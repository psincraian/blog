# 📖 Some history

I still remember the reasons to create pepy.tech. Nowadays, these three reasons still apply:
I want to learn and improve my skills.
I want to help the community.
I love Python.

Two years ago, I registered the domain, concretely on March 10 of 2018, and since then things have changed a little bit. The first version of PePy was using Bootstrap, hosted in Google App Engine, and only had 50 visitors with a lot of propaganda in Python forums. Nowadays, none of these apply.

I had the service deployed in Google Cloud, then AWS, then Heroku, and finally DigitalOcean. I always switched for the same reason: money 💵. Having to pay 50$ to host an open-source project without any income is not suitable for my pocket. Now, I’m paying 6$ with VAT included in DigitalOcean.

On May 27 of 2018, I made the website public 🙌🏼 It remained and will remain open. You can view the code, all the passwords (encrypted 🔒), and everything!

As I mentioned, one of the purposes of creating pepy.tech was to learn new tools and keep improving. Then I decided that it’s time to enhance my frontend skills, so I started to learn React, and I rebuilt the frontend with React. It was a pleasant experience, and nowadays, I really like this framework. No worries, Python it’s still a lot better than Javascript 🐍❤️

📝 In December, I started a blog; it hadn’t some activity recently, but hopefully, this will change. If you want to promote your library for free, you can publish a post here 😉

In January I put some CarbonAds on the website, mainly to cover the costs of pepy.tech. At the end of this thread, you can see some interesting stats, also the income that I had from the ads 🤫. I used this service because I love their philosophy to not be intrusive 🕵🏼‍♂️.

#  🔮 The future

Soon (remember, as software engineers never set a deadline 📆) I plan to include the following things:
View download stats per package version.
Have some beautiful graphs and not only tables.
Use MongoDB instead of Postgres (this can be another post).

Farther in the future exciting things could come, like: 
Personalized badges.
View full history of downloads.
Option to downloads of robots
View download stats by country, by python version, etc.
Weekly or monthly newsletter.
Related projects.
etc.

Comment in twitter you favorite one to better prioritize 🥇
